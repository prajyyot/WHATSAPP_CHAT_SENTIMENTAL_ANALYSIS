# Whatsapp-Chat-Anlysis

In this project of sentimental analysis I considered the whatsapp chat dataset which is a text file.
In this project i gain the insides of the whatsapp group chat in sentimental polarity score such as Positive, Negative and Neutral.

Where i perform the preprocessing with forming the functions to extract the time, extracting contacts or author or messager and the function of finding message in the text database.

The functioning of the sentimental analysis is done with the help of nltk toolkit of python.Nltk toolkit is widely used for natural languages processing.With the help of this division of text file is done, where various columns are formed with results. 
The overview of the results are shown with five entries:-
Positive  Negative  Neutral
0.098       0.0     0.902
0.268       0.0     0.732
0.128       0.0     0.872
0.000       0.0     1.000
0.000       0.0     1.000

And the overall sentiment score of the whatsapp chat was Neutral ðŸ™‚
